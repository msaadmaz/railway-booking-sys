CS 336 Final Project
For private use only - do not distribute

## Group Members:

Group 8

Jason Mustafa (II. Browsing and search functionality, III. Reservations)
Muhammad Mazhar (IV. Messaging functions)
Taha Shaikh (V. Admin functions)
Jeremy Desmond (VI. Customer representative)

We would like our parts of the project graded individually/separately.
Jeremy did not respond to our messages on time so we did not submit customer representative functions, because that was the part he was responsible for.
